3. Write an appropriate comment block for the beginning of a program to describe an application that is intended to calculate test averages.

Need I say more? Genuinely? Or is that honestly just description enough?




4. Write an appropriate comment for describing a class that displays the average of a set of scores.

// This class displays the average of a set of scores.

I honestly don't think this can be simplified any further.




5. Write a statement that declares a package with the name gradeCalculator

package gradeCalculator;




6. Write a statement that declares a class named AverageScore that is availible to any code.

public class AverageScore {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		System.out.println("Sure, this is basic, and a good refresher, but really? Should I put ANYTHING inside this?");
		System.out.println("I NEED SOMETHING TO LOOK AT BECAUSE I AM A WHOLE CHILD. EYEBALLS NEED CONSTANT ENTERTAINMENT.");
		System.out.println("WHERE IS THING FOR ME TO LOOK AT. :sobbing_emoji: :sobbing_emoji: :sobbing_emoji:");
		System.out.println("And before you ask, yes colons were intentional");
		
	}
